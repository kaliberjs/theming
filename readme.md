# @kaliber/theming
Provides convenient, nestable theming for you React components.

## Motivation
`@kaliber/theming` helps you build themable components, which automatically adapt to the theme they're used in. Nestable theming is traditionally a hairy CSS problem which React's Context helps you solve elegantly. This library is just a thin layer around such a Context, with a little bit of typing sprinkled into the mix. It aims to provide a common 'best practice'.

## Installation

```
yarn add @kaliber/theming
```

## Usage

To use theming in your components, wrap your app in the `ThemeProvider` component. You provide it with a theme object, containing your theme properties, through the `theme` prop. If you use CSS modules, all you have to do is:

```jsx
import brandTheme from '/themes/brand.css'

<ThemeProvider theme={brandTheme}>
  {children}
</ThemeProvider>
```

Apply the styles in the provider's subtree using the `useTheme()` hook. You can use the returned `theme` object alongside your regular styles:

```jsx
function Component({ children }) {
  const theme = useTheme()
  
  return (
    <div 
      className={cx(styles.component, theme.backgroundColor, theme.color)} 
      {...{ children }} 
    />
  )
}
```

To change the theme, you can use the `ThemeProvider` component. Simply pass it the new theme, and all child components will now use this theme instead. To make this even more effortless you can define your own `Theme` components, which provide a hardcoded theme:

```jsx
function ThemeBrand({ children }) { 
  return <ThemeProvider theme={brandTheme} {...{ children }} />
}

<ThemeBrand>
  <Component/>
</ThemeBrand>
```

### A note on working with Higgins and `@kaliber/build`'s `colorSchemes` convention
If you have are running a project with React components embedded in your PHP pages, there's a chance you're already using `colorSchemes`, adhering to `@kaliber/build`'s colorScheme naming convention. It's possible to have this library interop with those styles, by defining a legacy default theme, which is implemented using these `colorScheme` classes:

```js
const themes = {
  default: defaultTheme,
  brand: brandTheme,
  contrast: contrastTheme,
  legacy: {
    textColor: 'colorScheme-textColor',
    accentColor: 'colorScheme-accentColor',
    focusColor: 'colorScheme-focusColor',
    backgroundColor: 'colorScheme-backgroundColor',
  }
}
```

```jsx
import { themes } from '/themes'

<ThemeProvider theme={themes.legacy}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

ðŸ‘‰ If you'd like your themed components to use another `colorScheme` than the current one, you should swap to a nonlegacy theme. Wrapping components in a `<div className='colorScheme colorScheme--brand'>` will work but you may not nest these `div`s. This can be counter-intuitive, because regular themes can be nested as you see fit, leading to unexpected bugs.

## Example
For a more complete example, check the example directory in the Github repo.

`themes/contrast.css`
```css
.color {
  color: var(--color-gray-100);
} 

.accentColor {
  color: var(--color-pink-500);
}

.focusColor {
  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    color: var(--color-pink-500);
  }
}

.backgroundColor {
  background-color: var(--color-gray-900);
}
```

`themes/index.js`
```js
import brand from './brand.css'
import contrast from './contrast.css'

export const themes = {
  brand,
  contrast
}
```

`components/Theme.js`
```jsx
import { useThemes, ThemeProvider } from '@kaliber/theming'

export function ThemeBrand({ children }) {
  const themes = useThemes()
  return <ThemeProvider theme={themes.brand} {...{ children }} />
}

export function ThemeContrast({ children }) {
  const themes = useThemes()
  return <ThemeProvider theme={themes.contrast} {...{ children }} />
}
```

`components/Component.js`
```jsx
import { useTheme } from '/components/Theme'

function Component() {
  const theme = useTheme()
  return (
    <div className={cx(theme.backgroundColor, theme.color)}>
      This is a themed component
    </div>
  )
}
```

`App.js`
```jsx
import { themes } from '/themes'
export default function AppWithProviders() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={themes.legacy}>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

# Reference

## `ThemeProvider`
Wrap this around a subtree, to render all children in the theme passed to the `theme` prop.

| Props | |
| --- | --- |
| `theme` (required) | One of the available `theme` objects in `themes`. Use the `useThemes` hook to get a reference to the `themes` object. |

## `useTheme`

## Disclaimer
The usage of `@kaliber/theming` is build around the use of CSS modules. That being said, this library does not explicitly reference CSS modules, so you might be able to adjust it to a styling library of your choice.

This library is intended for internal use, we provide __no__ support, use at your own risk. It does not import React, but expects it to be provided, which [@kaliber/build](https://kaliberjs.github.io/build/) can handle for you.

This library is not transpiled.
